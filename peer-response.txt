Aspects I like:

1. I like that your website is informative overall and I can tell that you enjoy hiking. The mountain shape on top of your navigation is cool!
2. I appreciate that you included safety tips so that new hikers would know what to be aware of when hiking.
Advice:

1. I feel like the photos in your Destinations and Safety Tips page is a little big and it takes up a lot of the space. I suggest making it smaller or similar to the format you did with the Hurricane Ridge section.
2. I noticed that your content on your Destinations page are not scaling properly as well as the image on the Safety Tips page. In the photo, the container is still the same size while the background and navigation is scaling correctly. I think it scales fine when the window is bigger but not when its compressed or for mobile devices. It seems that the Hurricane Ridge section is scaling good until its below 750px. I suggest adding more media queries.
3. recommend adding some margins for the content on the Home and Safety Tips page so it looks more appealing rather than having it directly on the side.


-CHANGES MADE TO ASSISNGMENT-

1. ADJUSTED IMAGE SIZES SIMILAR TO THE HURRICANE RIDGE SECTION
2. IMPLEMENTED RELATIVE UNIT/REM TO SCALE WITH THE IMAGE WITH THE ZOOM ON THE USER'S DEVICE.
3. REWORKED THE SAFETY AND TIPS PAGE WITH BORDERS AND PROPER MARGINS TO DISPLAY CONTENT EFFICIENTLY AND NEATLY.
4. IMPLEMENTED GOOGLE FONT ON INDEX.HTML "EVERGREEN STATE!" -LORA STYLE FONT
